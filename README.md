## Abstract

This project investigates firm prediction using machine learning. By analyzing financial features such as income, liabilities, and expenses, we developed and evaluated several models. The **Bayesian Ridge Regressor** emerged as the top-performing model, achieving high accuracy and low prediction error. The project demonstrates the effectiveness of ensemble methods in firms prediction.

## Features and Data

### Dataset
The dataset comprises financial records from various firms with the following key features:
- **Total income**
- **Total liabilities**
- **Total assets**
- **Profit after tax**
- **Total expenses**
- **Indirect taxes**
- **Rent & lease rent**
- **Sales**
- **Income from financial services**
- **Other income**

### Preprocessing
1. **Handling Missing Values**: Missing values were imputed using the mean of the respective columns.
2. **Feature Scaling**: StandardScaler was used to normalize feature values.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizations like correlation heatmaps were used to understand relationships between features.

## Models Implemented

The following regression models were used and evaluated:
- **Random Forest Regressor** 
- **Decision Tree Regressor**
- **XGBoost Regressor**
- **Gradient Boosting Regressor**
- **AdaBoost Regressor**
- **Bayesian Ridge Regressor**  (Best Performer)

### Evaluation Metrics
